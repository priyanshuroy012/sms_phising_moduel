## 🚨 What is Email Phishing?

Email phishing is a **fraudulent cyber-attack technique** where attackers impersonate trusted organizations or individuals to deceive users into revealing sensitive information.

Phishing emails may include:

* Malicious attachments
* Fake login pages
* Harmful URLs
* Requests for confidential data

### ⚠️ Harms Caused

* Identity theft
* Unauthorized bank transactions
* Academic data breaches
* Loss of personal files
* Malware infections

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

* Modern phishing emails often **bypass spam filters** and land directly in inboxes.
* Users are tricked into clicking malicious links or sharing credentials.
* Campuses are heavily targeted through emails disguised as academic or administrative messages.

This leads to:

* Password theft
* Financial fraud
* Compromised student portals
* Institutional data leaks

---
